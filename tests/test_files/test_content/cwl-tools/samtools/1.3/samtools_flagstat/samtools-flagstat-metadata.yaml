  samtools flagstat in.sam|in.bam|in.cram

  Does a full pass through the input file to calculate and print statistics to stdout.

  Provides counts for each of 13 categories based primarily on bit flags in the FLAG field. Each category in the output is broken down into QC pass and QC fail, which is presented as "#PASS + #FAIL" followed by a description of the category.

  The first row of output gives the total number of reads that are QC pass and fail (according to flag bit 0x200). For example:

  122 + 28 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)

  Which would indicate that there are a total of 150 reads in the input file, 122 of which are marked as QC pass and 28 of which are marked as "not passing quality controls"

  Following this, additional categories are given for reads which are:

  secondary
  0x100 bit set

  supplementary
  0x800 bit set

  duplicates
  0x400 bit set

  mapped
  0x4 bit not set

  paired in sequencing
  0x1 bit set

  read1
  both 0x1 and 0x40 bits set

  read2
  both 0x1 and 0x80 bits set

  properly paired
  both 0x1 and 0x2 bits set and 0x4 bit not set

  with itself and mate mapped
  0x1 bit set and neither 0x4 nor 0x8 bits set

  singletons
  both 0x1 and 0x8 bits set and bit 0x4 not set

  And finally, two rows are given that additionally filter on the reference name (RNAME), mate reference name (MRNM), and mapping quality (MAPQ) fields:

  with mate mapped to a different chr
  0x1 bit set and neither 0x4 nor 0x8 bits set and MRNM not equal to RNAME

  with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
  0x1 bit set and neither 0x4 nor 0x8 bits set and MRNM not equal to RNAME and MAPQ >= 5
